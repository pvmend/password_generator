# Password Generator

https://pvmend.github.io/password_generator/

## Description 

Was tasked with writing Javascript that would generate a random password after 
getting user input about what characters they wanted in their password. 
I learned about how functions are used to call upon and executed. I learned and used random and for loops to generate a password and if statements to check if a requirements were met to execute the next action. 

## Installation 

Created a webpage through Github. (See link above). 

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
